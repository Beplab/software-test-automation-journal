Ensure Secure and Functional Code:
Tests and Quality Control: To make sure the code performs as expected, use extensive testing procedures like as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Conduct security testing as well to find and fix potential security flaws, such as penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
Participate in peer code reviews to identify potential problems and get input from other developers. Early in the development lifecycle, this method assists in identifying functional and security-related issues.
Utilize secure coding techniques: To reduce security vulnerabilities, follow secure coding best practices include input validation, output encoding, appropriate authentication and permission systems, and safe data storage.
Stay Updated: To make sure that known security vulnerabilities are patched, constantly check and update dependencies, libraries, and frameworks.
Compliance and Standards: To make sure your code satisfies accepted security benchmarks, abide by industry standards and best practices for security, such as those provided by OWASP.
How to Interpret User Needs:
Playful Listening Engage users and stakeholders to learn about their needs, worries, and goals. To fully understand what they are saying, pay close attention to their criticism and make clarifying inquiries.
Requirements Elicitation: To acquire specific requirements, use methods like workshops, questionnaires, and interviews. This guarantees that you appropriately capture user needs.
User Stories: Requirements should be framed as user stories that describe the user's objective, their activities, and the expected result. This aids in establishing a common understanding of the goal of the product.
Develop prototypes or mock-ups to visualize the functioning of the software and get user feedback early in the design phase.
Iteration: Adopt an iterative strategy in which you construct, test, and receive feedback repeatedly. This ensures that as the software changes, it continues to meet user needs.
How to approach software design
Analysis of Requirements Start by carefully comprehending the project's needs, objectives, and limitations. Determine the most important features and order them according to user requirements.
Modularity: Create software that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently by dividing it up into smaller, more manageable
